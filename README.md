# Spellwalrus

Spellwalrus is an automated wake-up call service designed to get you out of bed, after completing some simple mental tasks, like spelling WALRUS. Waking up is always easier when its social and fun and Spellwalrus aims to make waking up in the morning (when most of us have no desire whatsoever to get up) a little bit less painful.

The project utilizes the following APIs:
  1.  Twilio (for making phone calls)
  2.  Google App Engine (for hosting)

The project was written in Python.
