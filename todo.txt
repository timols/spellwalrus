Handle different time zones
For checking status, consider the case of updating an existing user's details
Add stop (unsubscribe) mechanism to phone calls
Custom 404 page
Update the results template to show a calendar view even if there are no calls for that user

LOW PRIORITY
Better styling of select and input[type='submit'] fields
Favicon!
Make users.views.ResultsHandler not explode in 2012
Organize/name templates better
Check firefox and safari rendering (IE is a lost cause on this one)
